# my google maps # 

### Concept ###
 
I want to create a system that harnesses the benefits of using location tracking technology to archive memories without the disadvantage of being data farmed by big tech.

I would like to use pictures to document the places I have been, the way my body has moved in a space, and how far I have travelled in a day without being encoded into fodder to be sold to big data companies.

This is a prototype that works on both laptops and mobiles, but more ideally on mobile. It allows you to track and archive your movement using your location and you can choose to document each current location by uploading a photo or taking a picture on the spot.

## Tech spec   ##

 Javascript, Leaflet API and OpenStreetMaps
